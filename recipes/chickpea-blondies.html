    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is an easy flourless chocolate chip chickpea blondie recipe. No one can taste that they are made
        with chickpeas instead of flour. They turn out soft and fudgy, and even sneak in some extra fiber! 
    </p>
    <p>The best part is that the chickpea cookie dough is amazing and you can eat it with a spoon! This recipe can also be 
        made with white beans (cannellini beans).
