    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is an easy and delicious banana bread recipe. This is my favorite banana bread recipe, I have been making it for years now! Get excited for a moist and gooey texture. 
        It can be eaten as a snack or breakfast. Try to pair it with tea or coffee.</p>
    <p>You don't need anything fancy to make it, just a bowl and spoon will do! My favorite way to eat is with a bunch of chocolate chips
        mixed in, but you can also add nuts or raisins! Whatever you like!
